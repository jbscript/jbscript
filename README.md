Hey, hereâ€™s a bit about me:
 - Got into coding early because I was exposed to computers at a young age.
 - Realized it's just a way to talk to computersâ€”what really matters is solving real-world problems.
 - Built multiple products, did freelance work, and worked at a couple of startups.
 - Now working on AssureQA, an AI-powered automation platform for smarter software testing. ðŸš€
